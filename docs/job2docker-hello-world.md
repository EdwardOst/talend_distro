## Basic HelloWorld Job

### Build Docker Job

The jobs directory includes a simple HelloWorld job.
Both the exported job and the built job are included for reference.
Use the `Import Items` capability to load `docker_hello_world.zip` into Studio.

![import job](pictures/import_items.jpg)

Use `Build Job` to generate the zip file in the shared directory previously created.

![build job](pictures/build_job.jpg)

Confirm that the docker image has been built

````
sudo docker images

REPOSITORY                                          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
eost/docker_hello_world                             0.1                 ce044e5cbcb7        About a minute ago   176MB

You should see output similar to the [job2docker_listener console](job2docker_listener_console_sample.md)

### Run Job in Container

You can run the HelloWorld job from the container using the Docker run command.

````
docker run eost/docker_hello_world:0.1
log4j:ERROR Could not connect to remote log4j server at [localhost]. We will try again later.
hello world
